# Embedding Models

## What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings convert text into numbers (vectors) that computers can understand. They capture the meaning of words, sentences, or documents in a way that similar texts have similar number representations.

For example, "I love pizza" and "Pizza is my favorite food" would have similar vector representations because they express similar ideas.

## Common Uses

Embeddings power many AI applications:

- **Smart Search:** Find relevant documents even without exact keyword matches
- **Text Classification:** Automatically categorize text content
- **Content Recommendations:** Suggest similar items to users
- **RAG Systems:** Help AI models access relevant information when answering questions

## Popular Embedding Models

- **OpenAI Embeddings:** Powerful, easy-to-use models via API
- **HuggingFace Models:** Open-source options for various use cases
- **Other Options:** Solutions from Google, Cohere, and others

## Key Features

- Embeddings are long number sequences (vectors)
- Similar texts have similar vectors
- Most models come pre-trained on large text datasets

---

## Best Practices

- Normalize your embeddings
- Choose models that fit your specific needs
- Use vector databases for efficient searching
- Test different models to find what works best

## Summary

Embeddings are essential tools in modern AI that convert text into a format computers can process effectively. They enable better search, recommendations, and AI applications by capturing the meaning of text in numerical form.
