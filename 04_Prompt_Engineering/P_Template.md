# Prompt Template in Langchain

A **Prompt Template** in Langchain is a structured way to dynamically create prompts by inserting variables into a predefined template. Instead of using hardcoded prompts, you can define placeholders that are filled in at runtime with different inputs.

This makes it:

* **Reusable**
* **Flexible**
* **Easy to manage**, especially when working with dynamic user inputs or automated workflows.

## Example of a Static Prompt Template

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

static_prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["text"], template="Summarize the following text: {text}")
```

### Features of Static Prompt Templates

1. **Reusability**:

   * You can save a prompt template in a file and use it later, making it easy to reuse without rewriting code every time.

2. **Input Validation**:

   * PromptTemplate ensures that input values adhere to the expected format. For instance, if a required variable is missing or if there are extra inputs, it will throw an error, preventing potential issues.

3. **Seamless Integration with Langchain**:

   * PromptTemplate integrates seamlessly with the Langchain ecosystem. It can easily be used as part of a larger chain of operations, which makes it much more powerful than simple string formatting like f-strings.
   * With Langchain's chaining capabilities, you can pass the output of one prompt into another or combine multiple prompt templates to form complex workflows.

### Why Not Use F-Strings?

While f-strings in Python allow you to insert variables into strings, **PromptTemplate** is preferred in Langchain for several reasons:

* **Better Reusability**: Templates can be saved and reused across different contexts.
* **Validation**: It includes built-in input validation to catch errors when inputs don't match the expected format.
* **Chaining Capabilities**: Langchain prompt templates integrate well with Langchain's chain system, allowing you to build complex workflows.

## Dynamic Prompt Templates

Dynamic prompt templates allow you to create messages that adapt based on input or context, making them ideal for personalized or context-sensitive responses.

### Example of a Dynamic Prompt Template

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

dynamic_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["user_name", "user_query"],
    template="Hello {user_name}, how can I assist you with {user_query}?"
)
```

### Key Features

1. **Personalization**: Tailors the message based on variables (e.g., user name, query).
2. **Flexibility**: Adjusts to different inputs, enabling dynamic workflows.
3. **Real-time Adaptation**: Adapts instantly based on the provided input.

### Why Use Dynamic Prompts?

Dynamic templates are perfect for scenarios like customer support, personalized assistants, or real-time data queries, where the response needs to change based on the user's input or context.
