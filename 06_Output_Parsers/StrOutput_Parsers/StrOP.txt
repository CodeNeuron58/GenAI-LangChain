String Output Parsers vs .content

What are String Output Parsers?
- Tools that extract and process specific text patterns from LLM responses
- Convert unstructured text responses into structured data
- Help parse and validate specific formats like dates, numbers, or custom patterns

When to use String Output Parsers:
1. When you need to extract specific information from text responses
2. For processing free-form text into structured data
3. When working with regex patterns and text matching
4. When dealing with common text formats (dates, emails, URLs)
5. For cleaning and standardizing text outputs

Benefits over .content:
1. Targeted information extraction
2. Pattern matching capabilities
3. Text normalization and cleaning
4. Format validation for specific patterns
5. Flexible text processing options

Limitations:
1. May miss context in complex responses
2. Dependent on consistent text patterns
3. Can be sensitive to response variations
4. Limited to text-based processing
5. Requires regular expression knowledge
