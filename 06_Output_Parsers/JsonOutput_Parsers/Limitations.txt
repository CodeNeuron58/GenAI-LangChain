Let's explore a limitation of JSON Output Parsers through an example.

Consider sending this prompt:
prompt = "Tell me 10 facts about humans"

With a JSON Output Parser, you typically get a fixed structure like:
{
    "facts": [
        "fact1",
        "fact2",
        ...
        "fact10"
    ]
}

This represents a single key containing an array of 10 facts.

However, what if we want a more flexible structure, such as:
{
    "fact1": "detail1",
    "fact2": "detail2",
    ...
    "fact10": "detail10"
}

Where each fact has its own key?

Standard JSON Output Parsers are limited in handling such dynamic structural changes. This is where Structured Output Parsers become valuable, as they offer greater flexibility in output formatting and structure.

These limitations demonstrate why we need StructuredOutput parsers.
