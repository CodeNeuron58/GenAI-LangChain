# **Chatbot - First Version i.e. First commit readme**

## What's This?

This is the first version of the chatbot. It's pretty basic—just answers questions on the spot and forgets everything right after. It doesn't remember past conversations, so each time you chat with it, it's like starting fresh. There’s no continuity, no memory, just straight-up Q\&A.

## What It Can Do

* **Answers**: Ask a question, get an answer. Simple as that.
* **No Memory**: It won’t remember what you said earlier. So if you ask something twice, it’ll treat it like a brand-new question.
* **No Context**: It can’t hold onto any of your past chats, so every response is based only on the current message.
* **One-and-Done Chats**: Each time you chat, it's like hitting the reset button. No building on previous talks.
