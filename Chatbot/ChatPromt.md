# Langchain Chat Prompt Template Issues

## Overview

While working with Langchain, I encountered some weird behavior with f-strings in the `chat_prompt_template.py` file. Sometimes, the usual f-string method doesn't work as expected, which can be frustrating. Instead, we have to use other built-in features or parameters, like `ChatPromptTemplate`, to format the prompts properly.

## Problem

In certain cases, using f-strings directly in the Langchain prompt templates causes issues, and the messages don't render as expected. To avoid this, we should use Langchain's in-built `ChatPromptTemplate` feature to format our prompts in a more reliable way.

## Solution

To solve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Use `ChatPromptTemplate`**: Instead of relying on f-strings directly, use Langchain's `ChatPromptTemplate` class to define and format the messages.

2. **Format the Prompt**: The `ChatPromptTemplate` class allows you to define structured prompts with placeholders, and it handles the formatting in a more robust way.

### Example Code

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Define the chat prompt template
chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("user", "{user_input}"),  # Placeholder for dynamic user input
    ("assistant", "Sure, here’s what I found: {response}")  # Placeholder for response
])

# Format the prompt with dynamic content
formatted_prompt = chat_prompt.format_messages(user_input="What's the weather like today?", response="It's sunny and 75°F.")
```

## Conclusion

Using `ChatPromptTemplate` in Langchain is a more reliable way to format prompts when the regular f-string approach fails. This method ensures that placeholders are properly substituted and avoids issues with f-strings not working as expected.
